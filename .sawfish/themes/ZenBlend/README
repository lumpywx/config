A simplicity theme, created by a modification of Nico Kaiser's
<http://siriux.net/> BlueCurve-Prion theme.  This theme was heavily
influenced by heylove's Infinite Simplicity Win XP theme
(http://www.deviantart.com/view/3537605/).  This is almost a clone of
that theme, actually.

The theme looks good with rxvt's started with this line:

alias rxvt='rxvt -vb -ls -bg "#f6f6f6" -vb -ls -cr "#a0a0a0" -fg "#a0a0a0" -C -fn 9x15 -sl 90000 +sb &'

It also fits well with the Industrial gnome control set.

And last, but not least, the Infinite Simplicity winamp theme by heylove:
