Updated 01/03/2001.

Aquarius for sawfish is an attempt to bring some of that Mac OS X look
and feel to sawfish.

Changed since the initial release:

o Minimize/maximize buttons used to move left/right a pixel or two
  between focused/unfocused states. This was because the yellow minimize
  button was a one pixel too thin, and the maximize button in turn was
  too wide. This is now fixed. Wonder why no one ever pointed that out.

o Inactive title bar is no longer blue, but white with lower contrast
  than the active one.

o The resize tab is now a bit closer to the real thing.

o Overall touch-up on the graphics.
