Aqua-Graphite by Overlord 
(overlord@overlordsdimension.net) - 1/28/2001

I decided to make an Aqua-Graphite theme after using the 
AquaGraphite gtk theme for so long. This theme does not 
have the original Aqua titlebar look, and it matches the 
AquaGraphite gtk theme by joeFeFiFo@wiredworks.com

This theme is based on Aquarius by Rami Valta 
(rami.valta@pp.inet.fi). The functionality is the same as 
Aquarius and that was my intention. Enjoy!

- UPDATE 2/19/2001 -
Cleaned up the pixmaps, they had a an extra line of pixels 
that made the title bar look wierd on dark backgrounds. This
was a quick fix, and I feel it is needed because not everyone
uses light backgrounds.
