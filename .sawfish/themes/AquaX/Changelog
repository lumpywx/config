21Sep00: Released v1.0.2 "Falling Leaves"

19Sep00: Installed 20000919 snapshots to test for compliance w/ pending
	   0.31 release of sawfish.
	 Added defines for various frame-component variables that had
	   previously been only setq'd. (Most of these had been in the
	   development series prior to v1.0, but were deleted during the
	   release clean-up since the theme worked without them.)

23Jul00: In my rush to clean up the files for release, I deleted a few
	   important lines from the released copy of theme.jl. My sincere
	   apologies--although wanting to get 2 hours of sleep before work
	   is no excuse. My bad.
	 Released v1.0.1 "For Michael Collins, Jeffrey, and Me"  

22Jul00: Released v1.0 "Tranquility Base"

20Jul00: After much wailing, gnashing of teeth, and banging of head upon
	   wall, I have both button-layout and cursor style working (if I
	   reload & reframe).
	 We now support button layouts corresponding to AquaX, Amiga, KDE,
	   MacOS-Platinum, MS-Windows, and WindowMaker.
	 In order to support KDE & MacOS-Platinum, began rudimentary support
	   of sticky & shade buttons.
	 We now support both AquaX and Sawmill cursor styles.
	 Added the outlines of an Expert configuration mode which allows
	   complete control over the location of buttons and their cursor
	   styles. (Deferred until after current release is complete.)
	 (Does all this mean I'm finally grokking rep???)
	 Sticky button support is complete and functional!
	 Shade button support is complete and functional!
	 Created additional one_window button images.

27Jun00: First steps toward modularizing the frame specifications with an
	   eye toward user-configurable button positions, ala Operational.

26Jun00: Successfully added configuration options for title font & colors.
	   (It took me 3 days to realize I needed ` instead of ' --- oh well,
	   it was a *very* rough weekend at work--the severe thunderstorms and
	   resulting downtime during my precious few waking off-hours didn't
	   help. Sigh!)

23Jun00: Began applying the lessons learned from the Operational theme.
	 Many thanks to Pedro Lopes (paol@teleweb.pt) for this ground-breaking
	   work!!

15Jun00: Verified against v0.28 of "sawfish", cleaned up theme.jl formatting.
	 Released v0.6 (pending receipt of fresh README.ja)

08May00: Received a Japanese translation of README, README.ja from Hirofumi
	   Takeda <takepin@turbolinux.co.jp>. Thank you!!!	 

24Mar00: Override default cursor for title bar with left_ptr as well

19Mar00: Added top border pixel to frames

20Jan00: Revised foreground to use different colors for inactive/focused

20Jan00: Included revised clicked-state button images from Christoph Rauch
	   <smokey@pfaffenhofen.de>. Christoph also caught the borders on the
	   inactive button images that were missed during the v0.2 cleanup.
	 Having received two requests for more Aqua-like cursor images, revised
	   theme.jl to include cursor statements for each button to override the
	   class default cursor with left_ptr. (although we use hand2 for the
	   the one-window button as suggested by Christoph). Feel free to alter
	   these to suit your personal tastes or comment them out entirely.
	 Deleted theme.jl-0.19--it's been a week, so y'all should be using 0.21
	   or later ;-)
	 Released v0.5

15Jan00: Squashed a painfully stupid bug caused by a typo--it seems there is no
	   "mazimize" function in sawmill.  (Gawd! I'm so embarrassed.)
	   Thanks to Josh Barrow <linuxfan@ionet.net> for pointing out the
	   problem (while being kind enough not to make any snide remarks
	   about using a spell checker).
	 Removed the byte-compiled theme.jlc. According to a recent message from
	   John on the sawmill list, themes are interpreted only.
	 Released v0.4
	
14Jan00: Updated theme.jl to utilize new syntax provided in sawmill-0.21 which
	   allows us to highlight buttons on unfocused windows while in
	   "click-to-focus" mode. This is more consistent with the behavior
	   shown in Apple's video clips.  Thanks, John!!
	 Prepared to release v0.2
	 Reviewed a modified version of my theme sent to me by Lyonel Vincent
	   <vincentl@ec-lyon.fr>. Corrected a few color glitches he found in
	   the bottom border. Incorporated the 1-pixel border for the sides of
	   the default frame and for the sides and bottom of the transient
	   frame, but decided not to include it in shaped frames.
	 Bumped version to 0.3 to avoid confusion w/ Vincent's AquaX-lv.

08Jan00: Replaced title_[lr]-active.png with a pair of graphics submitted by
	   Dean Scott <drscott12@hotmail.com>, which removed some extraneous
	   pixels.
	 Applied the same changes to the inactive titlebar graphics.
	 David Chan <dchan@d.umn.edu> sent some pngs for titlebar ends for
	   shaped windows. These were tweaked with the same changes as above
	   to provide the new shaped-window titlebars.
	 Revised theme.jl to incorporate new shaped-window titlebars.
	 Added clicked-state button images.

07Jan00: v0.1 - First public release
