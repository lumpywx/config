MacOS X mockup theme - based loosely on the screenshot in 
apple website.

Based on tigert's AquaOS theme, which is itself based on
the Marathon config files.

Created by Kenneth Christiánsen & Tuomas Kuosmanen

Added splatted buttons, drag zones and fixed a few bugs.
Hacked the above's artwork and lisp code.

theme.jl:
 fixed a bug where bottom border was not used.
 fixed a bug where shaped windows (shaded) still had sides.
 moved the buttons in a tad and added dragzones to top left and right.
 added image for splatted buttons.

I drew an ugly splat image and found a magic GIMP function to make it
 pretty: the warp filter on the splat and the original button image.
