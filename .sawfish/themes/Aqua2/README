I creates this theme based on another theme called "AquaZ" by Cosmo
which was based on a theme called "AquaOS2" which was based on
a theme called "AquaOS" by TigerT which was a modified Marathon.

This is based on the MacOS-X default look-and-feel, with the buttons
on the right instead of the left.

I updated the theme to Sawmill 0.25.2 and above, simplified it and removed
unreferenced pixmaps.

This theme was created with sawmill-themer and will work with Sawmill
0.25.2 and 0.26 at least (I don't know if it works with anything lower).
