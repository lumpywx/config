This is the HeliX-Clean theme for sawfish by Justin R. Miller.  It is 
based heavily on the Clean theme by Dwight Engen.  For more info on 
his original theme, check out:

In addition, I've provided a modified gtkrc for use with Dwight's Clean 
theme engine.  It is color-coordinated with my sawfish theme.  You'll 
need to download and install his Clean GTK theme and then use this gtkrc 
in place of the one that is installed.  

Feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns!

Enjoy!
