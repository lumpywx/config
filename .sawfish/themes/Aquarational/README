Operational

This theme is based on the KDE "Operational" theme, by Juliano 
Soares dos Santos (juliano@eps.ufsc.br)

Features:
- Highly customizable look&feel. In particular it lets you choose 
  the layout of the buttons on the window titlebar.
- Can show the application icon in the titlebar like Windows or
  KDE. This will look best if sawfish is compiled with gdk-pixbuf 
  istead of Imlib.

A .gtkrc.mine is included - just copy it to your home dir to get
matching colors in Gnome/GTK. Enjoy!
