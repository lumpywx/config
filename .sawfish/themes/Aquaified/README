This theme is due to the efforts of the following 
    people:

- Apple Computer Corporation for designing the 
    Aqua GUI. Most likely all images are copyright 
    Apple Computer 2000.
- The author of the Marathon theme.
- Tigert for his ``AquaOS'' theme, based on the 
    Marathon theme.
- The author of the ``AquaOS2'' theme, based on 
    the ``AquaOS'' theme.
- Manuel McLure <mmclure@sac.verio.net> for 
    his ``Aqua2'' theme, based on the ``AquaOS2'' 
    theme.
- Justin Hahn <jeh@isomorphic.net> who based 
    this theme on ``Aqua2''.


The following changes distinguish this theme 
    from other MacOS X themes:

- Cleaner frame parts: no part is dual purpose
    (i.e. button pieces don't include corners, 
    etc.)
- Proper button order, function, and mouse
    overs with respect to MacOS X.

Recent Changes:
- Minor clean ups
- Added clicked button stats donated by
    chrisw@globes.net
- Added shaded and shaded-transient window
    states

Now known to work with 0.30.3
